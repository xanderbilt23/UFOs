# UFOs

## Overview

Provided a more in-depth analysis of UFO sightings by allowing users to filter for multiple criteria at the same time. In addition to the date, table filters for the city, state, country, and shape were added.

## Results

Use the 'Filter Search' to search for the wanted criteria and press 'Enter' on keyboard. Note that it is all lower case and that each filter is not require to conduct a search.

## Summary

A drawback is that the filter search is case sensitive and will not return results if a state is in all caps or spelled out.
It's recommended to have a clear filter button. Also recommend adding a search button instead of having the user press enter on the keyboard.
